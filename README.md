# photOn-App

This is a web application which is similar to the way Instagram works. (Comments and likes to pics not supported).

To run it:

Set up express framework and create a project.

Replace the corresponding files in the created project with the files from the repository.

Dont forget to setup a mongoDB for this and specify the details of the database appropriately in  the code.

#Tip : You can use the mongoDB available on the code. Simple to incorporate it. https://mlab.com/

Thats all. You're good to go.
